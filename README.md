To ensure people engage with a web page, it is important to make it an easy-to-read and visually appealing website.
Adding a navigation bar on the top helps viewers easily access different pages, encouraging them to explore deeper into the site.
Each page has a lot of information and it can be overwhelming to see. For that reason, I split each page into different sections by topic.
With these in mind, I added a navigation bar with links within the page to help break down each page and make each section easy to access depending on what the viewer needs.
If I had more time, I would try to make the pages more aesthetically pleasing and add better styling to each class, especially the sidebars.
I also think the pages would look more professional with better-separated sections within the pages and centered headers.
Personally, there is so much information thrown at the viewer in each section.
Making the images smaller or shortening the amount of space may have helped this.
